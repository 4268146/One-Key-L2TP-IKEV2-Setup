# One-Key-L2TP-IKEV2-Setup

[Ref1]  
[Ref2]  
[Ref3]  


Only tested on Digital Ocean **Debian** 7, 8, 32bit and 64 bit.  
Well I guess it would work on Ubuntu, LOL.

The l2tp VPN supports IKEv1, IKEv2, etc.

So iOS, Windows desktop version, Android are all supported, esp the 1% Windows Phone user :)

About how to use it, please check the [ref3] part 4.
